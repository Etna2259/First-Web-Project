# Web & Mobile Technology Group Project
This is a Clinic webpage redesigned in a group project in a course work back in 2021/6.
This page is accessible via [etna2259.github.io](https://etna2259.github.io/First-Web-Project/)

Features of this page includes:
- Interactive in-page map showing the clinic's location
- Multiple redirected pages describing the clinic's services
- Available in 2 languages both in English and Japanese via a drop down menu for language swap (Not website wide unfortunately)
- Optimizied for both Desktop and Mobile devices viewing experience

##This page is special because it is my first independent project working with web development
